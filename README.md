Several quines in C and possibly ASM :)

# First part: Colleen
A simple quine. It's likely not the shortest one you've seen.
I've had several constraints, though:
	1. The source file and its output must be absolutely identical.
	2. There must be two comments: one inside main() and one in the file scope.
Did I do good? :)
