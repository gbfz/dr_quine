Quines in C and possibly ASM
A quine is a program whose output is identical to its source code. That's it :)
The goal of dr-quine is to create three quines with different constrains.

# First part: Colleen
A simple one. Just store the source code as a string inside the program.

# Second part: Grace
A bit more tough. Self-replication must be done with C macros.

# Third part: Sully
// TODO :)
